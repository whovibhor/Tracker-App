# 📋 Expense Tracker App Improvement Plan

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### What Users Currently Experience:
1. **Confusing Flow**: Open app → "Add Asset/Liability" → ❌ What's that?
2. **Limited Categories**: Only basic tags like "Food", "Transport"
3. **No Payment Tracking**: Can't see if they spent via Cash/Card/UPI
4. **Manual Entry**: Must enter "Monthly Rent" every month manually
5. **No Budget Control**: No warning when overspending

### What Users Actually Need:
1. **Simple Flow**: Open app → "Add Expense" → ✅ Clear!
2. **Detailed Categories**: "Food" → "Groceries", "Restaurants", "Coffee"
3. **Payment Method**: Track Cash/Card/UPI spending patterns
4. **Smart Recurring**: Set "Rent = ₹10,000/month" once, auto-create entries
5. **Budget Alerts**: "⚠️ You've spent ₹8,000/₹10,000 food budget this month"
